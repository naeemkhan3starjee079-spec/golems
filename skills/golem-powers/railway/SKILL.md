# Railway Operations

> Manages the golems cloud-worker service on Railway. The cloud-worker runs email poller, job scraper, briefing, and soltome learner.

## Working Directory

Railway CLI commands can be run directly — no `cd` required. The `railway` CLI uses the linked project config, not the working directory.

If you do get a "Could not find root directory" error, it means `railway link` has not been run yet for this project.

## When to Deploy

Deploy to Railway after merging PRs that change:
- `packages/services/src/cloud-worker.ts` (schedules, worker config)
- `packages/shared/src/email/` (email processing)
- `packages/jobs/src/` (job scraping)
- `packages/shared/src/lib/cloud-llm.ts` (Haiku backend)
- `railway.json`

Do NOT forget to deploy after backend PRs merge. Use the CLI — no "manual redeploy" needed.
