# Nightly Docs Update

> Keeps etanheyman.com/golems in sync with the actual golems repo state. Runs stats collection, updates hardcoded numbers, detects dead references, and creates a PR.

## When to Use

- **Nightly:** Scheduled run to catch stat drift
- **Post-merge:** After significant golems PRs (new packages, skill additions, test changes)
- **Manual:** When someone says "docs are stale" or "numbers look wrong"

## Prerequisites

- `~/Gits/golems` exists and is a git repo
- `~/Gits/etanheyman.com` exists and is a git repo
- `gh` CLI authenticated
- `sqlite3` available (for BrainLayer chunk count)
- BrainLayer DB at `~/.local/share/zikaron/zikaron.db`

## What It Does

The `scripts/default.sh` script runs in two phases:

### Phase 1: Collect Stats (from golems repo)

| Stat | Source | Command |
|------|--------|---------|
| Package count | `ls packages/` | `ls ~/Gits/golems/packages/ \| wc -l` |
| Package list | `ls packages/` | `ls ~/Gits/golems/packages/` |
| Test count | `bun test` | `bun test --reporter=summary 2>&1 \| grep -E 'pass\|fail'` |
| Skill count | `ls skills/` | `ls ~/Gits/golems/skills/golem-powers/ \| wc -l` |
| Skill eval coverage | evals.json | Count dirs with `evals/evals.json` |
| BrainLayer chunks | SQLite | `sqlite3 ~/.local/share/zikaron/zikaron.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunks'` |
| PRs merged | GitHub API | `gh pr list -R {GITHUB_USER}/golems --state merged --limit 999 \| wc -l` |
| MCP servers | `.mcp.json` | Count active servers |

Stats are written to a temp JSON for the update phase.

### Phase 2: Update etanheyman.com (in portfolio repo)

#### Automatable Updates (sed replacements)

| Target File | What Changes |
|-------------|-------------|
| `golems-stats.json` | Full stats regeneration |
| `project-showcase-config.ts` | Package count, PR count, skill count, chunk count |
| `terminal-showcase-config.ts` | BrainLayer chunk numbers in terminal demo |
| `content/golems/architecture.md` | Package count in description |
| `content/golems/getting-started.md` | Monorepo tree, skill count, chunk count |
| `content/golems/faq.md` | Chunk count references |
| `content/golems/zikaron.md` | Chunk count references |
| `content/golems/llm.md` | Chunk count, skill count |
| `content/golems/mcp-tools.md` | Chunk count references |
| `content/golems/journey.md` | Chunk count references |

#### Dead Reference Detection (warn only)

The script scans for references to packages that no longer exist:

| Dead Reference | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| `packages/autonomous/` | Removed — absorbed into services |
| `packages/orchestrator/` | Removed — now external repo at ~/Gits/orchestrator |
| `packages/dashboard/` | Renamed to `packages/docsite/` |
| `packages/ralph/` | Removed — ralph is now a skill + external repo |
| `packages/zikaron/` | Removed — now standalone BrainLayer repo |

Dead refs are **reported but not auto-fixed** — they may be historically accurate (journey sections).

### Phase 3: PR Creation

If any files changed:
1. Create branch `chore/nightly-docs-YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Commit with conventional message
3. Create PR with diff summary
4. Output PR URL

If no files changed: report "all stats current" and exit 0.

## Checklist of Places to Check

This is the full PRD of content that can drift. The script automates most of these.

### Hardcoded Numbers (HIGH priority — auto-fixable)

- [ ] Package count (currently 11)
- [ ] PR count (currently 261+)
- [ ] Skill count (currently 55)
- [ ] BrainLayer chunk count (currently 291K+)
- [ ] Test count and file count

### Structural References (MEDIUM priority — detection only)

- [ ] Package table in architecture.md matches actual `ls packages/`
- [ ] Monorepo tree in getting-started.md matches filesystem
- [ ] No references to removed packages (autonomous, orchestrator, dashboard, ralph, zikaron)
- [ ] Install commands reference correct package names (`docsite` not `dashboard`)

### Semantic Consistency (LOW priority — manual review)

- [ ] Golem count consistent across files (currently 7)
- [ ] Feature descriptions match actual CLAUDE.md per package
- [ ] External links still resolve (BrainLayer repo, VoiceLayer repo)

## Edge Cases

- **BrainLayer DB missing:** Skip chunk count, warn in output
- **Tests take too long:** Use `--skip-tests` flag to skip test counting
- **gh not authenticated:** Skip PR count, warn in output
- **etanheyman.com dirty:** Refuse to run, ask user to commit/stash first
- **No changes detected:** Exit 0 with "all current" message (not an error)

## Composability

- **Called by:** Night Shift (`@golems/services`), manual invocation
- **Calls:** `/pr-loop` for the PR creation step (when run manually with `--pr-loop`)
- **Produces:** `golems-stats.json` consumed by etanheyman.com dashboard

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Full run (collect + update + PR)
/nightly-docs-update

# Skip tests (faster, ~15s vs ~70s)
/nightly-docs-update --skip-tests

# Stats collection only (no file updates)
/nightly-docs-update --stats-only

# Detect dead refs only
/nightly-docs-update --dead-refs-only
```
