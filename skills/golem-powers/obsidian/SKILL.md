# Obsidian Vault Access

> Direct filesystem access to Obsidian vault. Use this when the Obsidian MCP is unavailable or unreliable.

## Vault Location

```bash
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/<your-vault>"
```

**Note:** Set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` in your shell profile. This is typically an iCloud-synced vault that syncs across devices.

## Safety Rules

1. **Don't delete notes** - Only create or update
2. **Preserve formatting** - Keep existing markdown structure
3. **Respect Hebrew content** - Some notes are in Hebrew, preserve encoding
4. **Backup before bulk changes** - iCloud syncs, but be careful with mass edits
