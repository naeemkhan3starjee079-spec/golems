# Freelance Workflow

## Before Anything Else

```
brain_search("coach freelance client <name>")
brain_search("coach contract pricing")
brain_search("coach invoice recent")
```

Look for: client history, past pricing decisions, contract terms, payment status.

## Contract Review

When reviewing a freelance contract:

1. **brain_search** for past contracts with this client (terms, rates, issues)
2. Read the contract carefully — look for:
   - Payment terms (Net 30? Net 60? Milestone-based?)
   - IP ownership clauses
   - Non-compete / exclusivity
   - Cancellation terms
   - Scope creep protection (change request process)
3. **Hebrew contracts** — respond in Hebrew. Use professional but clear language.
4. Flag any clause that deviates from standard Israeli freelance practice

### Contract Feedback Format (Hebrew)

When generating feedback on a contract, structure as:

```
## סקירת חוזה — [שם לקוח]

### סיכום
[1-2 sentences on overall assessment]

### נקודות לתשומת לב
- [Issue 1 — what it says, why it matters, suggested change]
- [Issue 2 — ...]

### המלצות
- [Specific actionable recommendations]

### הערות נוספות
[Anything else worth noting]
```

## Invoicing

When creating or discussing invoices:

1. **brain_search** for past invoices to this client (amounts, frequency)
2. Israeli invoicing requirements:
   - Must include: business number (osek murshe), date, invoice number, client details, VAT
   - VAT rate: brain_search("Israel VAT rate current") — rates change, don't hardcode
   - Receipt (kabala) vs. Invoice (heshbonit mas)

---

## Pricing

When discussing pricing for a project:

1. **brain_search** for past pricing decisions and market rates
2. Consider: scope, timeline, client relationship, market rate
3. Israeli freelance market context — brain_search for stored rate benchmarks
4. Always present as a range, not a single number
5. Factor in: preparation time, revisions, communication overhead

---

## Client Management

Every client interaction should be stored:

```
brain_store(
  content: "Coach client: <name> — <what happened>. Status: <active/completed/pending>. Next: <action>",
  tags: ["coach", "client", "<client-name>"],
  importance: 7
)
```

Before any client interaction: `brain_search("coach client <name>")` to recall full history.
