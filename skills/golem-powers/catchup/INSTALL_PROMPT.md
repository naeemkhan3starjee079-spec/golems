# Install: catchup

> Use when returning to work after any break — auto-detects depth. Short break (hours): reads only uncommitted changes. Long break (48h+) or context overflow: reads all branch changes vs main. Covers catchup, context recovery, refresh, rebuild understanding. NOT for: mid-task exploration (use Read/Grep directly).
