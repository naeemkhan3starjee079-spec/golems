name: convex
description: Use when working with Convex backend - dev server, deployment, function execution, data import/export. Wraps npx convex CLI. Covers convex, backend, serverless, functions, schema. NOT for: other databases (Supabase, Firebase, etc.), frontend-only work.

# Convex Operations

> Backend skill wrapping `npx convex` CLI. Routes to workflows for specific operations.

## Project Detection

Run first to verify you're in a Convex project:
```bash
[ -d "convex" ] && echo "Convex project detected" || echo "ERROR: No convex/ directory found"
```

If no `convex/` directory: Run `npx convex init` to initialize.

## Quick Actions

| What you want to do | Workflow |
|---------------------|----------|
| Start dev server | [workflows/dev.md](workflows/dev.md) |
| Deploy to production | [workflows/deploy.md](workflows/deploy.md) |
| Run a Convex function | [workflows/run-function.md](workflows/run-function.md) |
| Export data | [workflows/data-export.md](workflows/data-export.md) |
| Import data | [workflows/data-import.md](workflows/data-import.md) |
| Inspect/validate schema | [workflows/schema.md](workflows/schema.md) |
| Delete user and all data | [workflows/user-deletion.md](workflows/user-deletion.md) |
| Fix errors | [workflows/troubleshooting.md](workflows/troubleshooting.md) |

## Available Scripts

Execute directly - they handle errors and edge cases:

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/dev.sh` | Start dev server with auto-cleanup | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/dev.sh [--deployment <name>]` |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | Deploy to production | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/deploy.sh [--1p] [--dry-run]` |
| `scripts/run-function.sh` | Execute queries/mutations/actions | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/run-function.sh api:funcName [--args '{}']` |
| `scripts/export-data.sh` | Export database backup | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/export-data.sh [--path <file>]` |
| `scripts/import-data.sh` | Import data (with safety prompts) | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/import-data.sh --path <file.zip>` |

## Common Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npx convex dev                    # Start dev server with hot reload

# Deployment
npx convex deploy                 # Deploy to production

# Functions
npx convex run api:functionName   # Run a function
npx convex run api:func --arg '{"key":"value"}'  # With arguments

# Data
npx convex export --path ./backup.zip   # Export all data
npx convex import --path ./backup.zip   # Import data

# Environment
npx convex env list               # List env vars
npx convex env set KEY=value      # Set env var
npx convex env get KEY            # Get env var

# Other
npx convex dashboard              # Open dashboard in browser
npx convex codegen                # Regenerate types
npx convex logs --name prod       # View production logs
```

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Always check project** - Verify `convex/` directory exists before running commands
2. **Deploy key for CI** - Production deploys need `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` (see deploy workflow)
3. **Backup before import** - Always export before importing data
4. **Review schema changes** - Schema migrations can be destructive

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Auto-Clean Before Any Convex Command

**ALWAYS prefix Convex commands with this cleanup:**

```bash
rm -f convex/*.js 2>/dev/null; npx convex dev
```

### The "Two output files" Error

If you see:
```
✘ [ERROR] Two output files share the same path but have different contents: out/auth.js
```

**Cause:** Orphan `.js` files in `convex/` folder (from git worktrees, crashes, or manual operations).

**Fix:** `rm -f convex/*.js` then retry.

**Prevention:** Always use the cleanup prefix. Only `.ts` files belong in convex/.

See [workflows/troubleshooting.md](workflows/troubleshooting.md) for details.
