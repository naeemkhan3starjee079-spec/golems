# Example Bash Skill

> Demonstrates the bash script pattern for golem-powers skills.

This is a working example of **Pattern A** - a simple bash skill that executes immediately when loaded.

## What It Does

When you invoke `/golem-powers:example-bash`, the script `scripts/hello.sh` runs automatically and outputs:

1. Current timestamp
2. Working directory
3. Git branch (if in a repo)
4. A friendly message

## Usage

This skill runs automatically when loaded. No additional input needed.

## Why Use Bash Pattern?

Choose bash (Pattern A) when your skill:

- Wraps existing CLI tools
- Needs no external dependencies
- Has simple, linear logic
- Outputs text/Markdown directly
