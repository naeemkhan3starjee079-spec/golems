## Executive Summary

Claude Code's plugin system is now mature. Our golems ecosystem can be repackaged as a **branded Claude Code plugin** with an install wizard, addons system, and marketplace-ready distribution. This positions us perfectly against the "AI leadership" trend (see Oren Yam's post - engineering = managing agent teams).

**Architecture principle (v2):** Golems are **domain experts** (Recruiter, Teller, Content, Claude), not I/O channels. Email, Telegram, Soltome, CLI are just interfaces. Zikaron and Ollama are infrastructure. NightShift and Briefing are scheduling patterns, not golems. See Part 14 for full architecture.

---

## Part 1: What Claude Code Now Offers (vs What We Built)

### Official Features vs Golems

| Feature | Claude Code Official | Golems | Status |
|---------|---------------------|--------|--------|
| **Memory** | CLAUDE.md hierarchy + auto-memory (NEW 2.1.32) | Zikaron (sqlite-vec, semantic search, 200k+ chunks) | Complementary - ours is retrospective, theirs is prescriptive |
| **Skills/Commands** | `.claude/skills/` + plugin system | `.claude/commands/golem-powers/` | Should migrate to plugin format |
| **Subagents** | Custom agents in `.claude/agents/` with persistent memory | Ralph loop + Night Shift + specialized golems | Theirs is simpler; ours is more autonomous |
| **Agent Teams** | EXPERIMENTAL - multi-agent orchestration | Ralph (proven, battle-tested) | Wait for theirs to mature, keep Ralph |
| **Notifications** | None | Telegram bot + notifications server | **Unique differentiator** |
| **Job Pipeline** | None | JobGolem + RecruiterGolem | **Unique differentiator** |
| **Content Creation** | None | Soltome + post generator | **Unique differentiator** |
| **Email Triage** | None | EmailGolem | **Unique differentiator** |

### Key Takeaway

Claude Code now handles the "foundation" (memory, commands, subagents) well. Golems' value is in the **domain-specific automations** on top - recruiting, email, content, night shift. These are addons that make Claude Code actually useful for daily life.

### Install Wizard Flow

```
$ npx golems-cli install

Welcome to Golems! 🤖

Step 1: Core Setup
  ✓ Creating $GOLEMS_DATA/
  ✓ Installing Claude Code plugin
  ✓ Setting up CLAUDE.md hierarchy

Step 2: Choose Addons (select with space)
  [x] Core (base) - Scheduler, morning briefing, notify, golems CLI
  [ ] RecruiterGolem - Jobs, outreach, interviews, job email routing
      → Requires: Ollama (for scoring)
      → Optional: Hunter.io, Lusha (for contacts)
  [ ] TellerGolem - Tax filing, subscriptions, financial email routing
      → Requires: Sophtron MCP (bank data)
      → Optional: Gmail OAuth (for subscription emails)
  [ ] ContentGolem - Multi-platform content (Soltome, blog, etc.)
      → Optional: Soltome API key, Zikaron (style analysis)
  [ ] Email Router - Gmail triage, routes to other golems
      → Requires: Gmail OAuth
      → Enhanced by: RecruiterGolem, TellerGolem (smart routing)
  [ ] Zikaron - Memory layer (semantic search, style analysis)
      → Requires: Python 3.10+, ~2GB disk (embeddings model)

Step 3: Notification Channel
  ( ) Telegram (group with topics)
  (x) WhatsApp (via WhatsApp Business API)
  ( ) Both
  ( ) None (CLI only)

Step 4: Schedule
  ✓ Installing launchd agents
  ✓ Night Shift: 4am daily
  ✓ Job scrape: every 30min
  ✓ Email triage: every 10min

Done! Run `golems status` to verify.
```

### Update Flow (3 audiences)

```
golems update
  ├── Auto: pull code, install deps, restart services
  ├── Auto: wire new MCP servers, skills, hooks
  └── Interactive: "These need your help:"
       ├── "Upload new recruiter-golem.md to claude.ai"
       ├── "Set HUNTER_API_KEY (want me to show you how?)"
       └── "New addon available: TellerGolem. Install? [y/n]"
```

**Technical users:** `golems update` + CHANGELOG.md, they handle the rest.

**Semi-technical (CLI-comfortable):** `golems update` spawns Claude that explains
what changed and guides them through manual steps interactively.

**Non-technical (Cowork/Telegram users):** Ask their Claude "update my golems" -
Claude runs `golems update` on their behalf, reads the CHANGELOG, walks them
through setup in natural language. The CLAUDE.md IS the docs for both humans and
Claude agents.

> Key insight: We don't build separate UX for non-technical users. We make the
> CLI and docs good enough that any Claude instance can operate it. The README
> is the API.

### Claude Chat Project Files (DONE - 2026-02-06)

`golems instructions` command shows uploadable markdown files for claude.ai:
- `contexts/claude-chat/recruiter-golem.md` - RecruiterGolem project instructions
- `contexts/claude-chat/claude-golem.md` - ClaudeGolem project instructions
- `contexts/claude-chat/style-card.md` - Owner style (auto-generated from Zikaron)

`golems regen-style` regenerates style-card.md from `semantic-style-data.json`.

Files can't be symlinked (claude.ai stores project instructions server-side only).
Users upload manually. `golems update` tells them when files changed.

### Addon Dependencies

```
golems-core (base) ← Scheduler, Briefing, Notify, CLI, event-log
├── RecruiterGolem
│   ├── needs: Ollama
│   ├── optional: Hunter.io, Lusha (contact emails)
│   └── optional: Email Router (job email routing)
├── TellerGolem
│   ├── needs: Sophtron MCP (bank data)
│   ├── absorbs: packages/tax-helper/
│   └── optional: Email Router (subscription email routing)
├── ContentGolem
│   ├── channels: Soltome, blog, LinkedIn (via RecruiterGolem)
│   ├── optional: Zikaron (style analysis)
│   └── optional: RecruiterGolem (branding collab)
├── Email Router (daemon, not a golem)
│   ├── needs: Gmail OAuth, Ollama
│   └── routes to: RecruiterGolem, TellerGolem, Claude Code
└── Zikaron (infrastructure, not a golem)
    ├── needs: Python, sentence-transformers, sqlite-vec
    └── enhances: all golems (memory + style)
```

### Smart Addon Discovery

When Claude encounters something it can't do but an addon could:

```
Claude: "I'd like to check your emails for job-related messages,
but EmailGolem isn't installed. Want me to set it up?
Run: golems addon install email-golem"
```

## Part 3: Notification Channel Migration

> **STATUS: DROPPED** - Root cause identified as iOS 26 beta APNs bug (affects ALL apps, not just Telegram).
> Keep Telegram as-is. Revisit when iOS 26 stable fixes push notifications.

### Problem (RESOLVED)
Telegram notifications don't deliver reliably - user only sees them when opening the app.

### Options

| Channel | Push Reliability | Setup Complexity | Cost |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| **WhatsApp Business API** | ✅ Excellent (always delivers) | Medium (Meta verification) | Free for first 1000 msgs/month |
| **WhatsApp via Twilio** | ✅ Excellent | Easy (Twilio account) | $0.005/msg |
| **WhatsApp Green API** | ✅ Good | Easy (no Meta approval) | $5.50/month |
| **Telegram** (current) | ⚠️ Unreliable push | Already done | Free |
| **ntfy.sh** | ✅ Good (push to phone) | Very easy | Free |
| **Pushover** | ✅ Excellent | Very easy | $5 one-time |

### Recommendation: Tiered approach

**Tier 1: Beeper Cloud (ZERO CODE - try first)**
- Install Beeper app, link Telegram + WhatsApp
- Existing Telegram bot notifications arrive via Beeper's unified push
- Solves the push problem immediately, no code changes
- Free (Beeper Cloud)
- If this works → skip Tier 2

**Tier 2: WhatsApp Communities via Green API ($5.50/mo)**
- Only if Beeper doesn't cut it (need native WhatsApp presence)
- WhatsApp Communities = Telegram Topics equivalent:
  ```
  Golems Community
  ├── 💬 Chat        → --resume whatsapp-chat (ClaudeGolem)
  ├── 👔 Recruiter   → --resume recruiter-golem
  ├── 📧 Email       → --resume email-assistant
  ├── 🔔 Alerts      → one-way notifications
  └── 🎯 Jobs        → one-way notifications
  ```
- Each group ID maps to a Claude session with its own persona
- Green API: REST API, no Meta approval, Node.js SDK

**Tier 3: Matrix bot + bridges (future, full control)**
- Self-hosted Matrix homeserver + mautrix bridges
- ONE bot codebase → all platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Discord, LinkedIn DMs)
- Full E2EE, you control the server
- Higher setup effort but most future-proof
- LinkedIn DM bridge = game changer for RecruiterGolem outreach

**Migration plan:**
1. Try Beeper Cloud first (5 min setup)
2. If push works → keep Telegram bot as-is, Beeper handles delivery
3. If need native WhatsApp → add Green API with Community routing
4. If scaling to multiple platforms → Matrix bot migration

---

## Part 4: Outreach Drafts → Obsidian

### Current Location
SQLite DB at `$GOLEMS_DATA/recruiter/outreach.db`

### Proposed: Obsidian Vault Integration

```
~/Obsidian/Golems/
├── Recruiter/
│   ├── Outreach/
│   │   ├── 2026-02-05-acme-corp.md    # One file per company
│   │   ├── 2026-02-05-startup-xyz.md
│   │   └── _index.md                  # Dashboard with status
│   ├── Contacts/
│   │   └── john-smith-acme.md
│   └── Pipeline/
│       └── _kanban.md                 # Application tracker
└── Jobs/
    ├── Hot/                           # Score 8+
    ├── Warm/                          # Score 6-7
    └── Archive/
```

### Each outreach file would look like:

```markdown
---
company: Acme Corp
contact: John Smith
role: Engineering Manager
score: 9
status: draft
message_type: email
created: 2026-02-05
---

# Outreach: Acme Corp - John Smith

## Job
Senior Full Stack Developer (Score: 9/10)
Tech: React, TypeScript, Node.js

## Draft Message
Subject: ...
Body: ...

## Status
- [ ] Review draft
- [ ] Personalize further
- [ ] Send
- [ ] Follow up (7 days)
```

---

## Part 5: Claude --continue / --fork-session for Telegram

### Current: Single persistent session
```bash
claude --resume telegram-chat
```

### Potential: Fork for deep dives
```bash
# User asks complex question in Telegram
# Bot forks current session for deep research
claude --resume telegram-chat --fork-session -p "Research X deeply"
# Fork preserves context but doesn't pollute main chat session
```

### Benefits:
- Main chat session stays focused
- Forked sessions can do deep work without bloating context
- Forked sessions could be indexed by Zikaron for future reference

### Index Impact:
- Track fork-parent relationships
- If same issue appears in multiple forks, flag for prompt improvement
- Use fork metadata to identify when conversations go in multiple directions

---

## Part 6: Legal Status (CLI Tools)

| Tool | Automation Legal | Cost | Recommendation |
|------|-----------------|------|----------------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Explicitly supported (SDK) | Subscription | Primary tool |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Explicitly supported | Free (1K/day) | Safe for research agents |
| **Kiro CLI** | ✅ Supported (AWS) | Free tier (50 credits) | Safe for specialized tasks |
| **Cursor CLI** | ⚠️ Ambiguous ToS for automation | Subscription credits | Use for interactive, get clarification for automation |

### Recommendation
- **Primary**: Claude Code (we're building on it)
- **Research fallback**: Gemini CLI (free, explicit automation support)
- **Cursor**: Use interactively, avoid heavy automation until ToS clarified

---

## Part 7: Semantic Style Distribution

### Currently Distributed To:
- `$GOLEMS_DATA/style/semantic-style-data.json` ✅ (loaded by style-adapter.ts)
- Zikaron archives at `zikaron/data/archives/style-*/` ✅

### Should Also Be In:
- Claude web/cowork: **Does NOT auto-get this** - you'd need to paste key style insights
- RecruiterGolem context: ✅ Already wired via style-adapter.ts
- Soltome posts: ✅ Already uses style data
- Obsidian (if added): Would need export script

### Recommendation:
Create a portable `my-communication-style.md` summary that can be:
1. Pasted into Claude.ai projects
2. Imported by any Claude Code session via `@import`
3. Shared across tools

---

## Part 8: Service Monitoring & Auto-Wiring

### Problem
Services fail silently. User sees `✗ job-golem (exit: 7501)` but no alert.

### Solution: Enhanced healthcheck

```bash
# golems doctor - comprehensive check
golems doctor

=== GOLEMS DOCTOR ===
✓ Telegram Bot     running (port 3847, last msg 5m ago)
✓ Ollama           running (qwen3 loaded)
✓ Job-Golem        scheduled (next run in 12m, last success 28m ago)
✓ Email-Golem      scheduled (next run in 3m, last success 7m ago)
✗ Job-Golem Sync   FAILING - Missing readFileSync import
  → Fix: golems latest
✓ Night Shift      scheduled (next: 4am, target: songscript)

Outreach Drafts: 3 pending review
Unread Job Alerts: 7
```

### Auto-Wire New Addons

When adding a new golem/service:
```bash
golems addon add my-new-golem
# Creates:
# - src/my-new-golem/index.ts (template)
# - launchd/com.golemszikaron.my-new-golem.plist
# - Adds to golems status/doctor
# - Adds to healthcheck
```

---

## Part 9: Positioning (Oren Yam Post Context)

The LinkedIn post describes the **xEngineer** - someone who manages a team of AI agents instead of writing code. This is EXACTLY what Golems enables:

> "הוא לא כתב שורת קוד אחת, אבל הוא מסופק."
> "He didn't write a single line of code, but he's satisfied."

### Golems = The xEngineer's Toolkit

| xEngineer Need (from post) | Golems Feature |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Delegation to agents | Night Shift, RecruiterGolem, EmailGolem |
| Monitoring agent work | `golems status`, `golems doctor` |
| Defining context & checkpoints | CLAUDE.md hierarchy, Zikaron memory |
| Business awareness | Morning briefing, job pipeline |
| Project management | Task tracking, PR management |
| Cost management ("moving to cheaper model") | Ollama for scoring, Claude for complex |
| Setting guardrails | SOUL.md, permission modes, vetted skills |

### For RecruiterGolem/Portfolio

This post + our project = strong positioning:
- "I built the system Oren describes - a team of AI agents I manage"
- "Here's how I coordinate 6 specialized agents for job search, email, code improvements"
- Portfolio project: **Golems - An xEngineer's Agent Team**

---

## Part 10: TellerGolem (NEW - Opus 4.6 Finance)

> **Monetization target.** Both Israel + US. Persona/CLAUDE.md needed like other golems.
> Already have `tax-helper` subagent + Sophtron MCP but no dedicated golem yet.
> ContentGolem is LOW priority standalone - RecruiterGolem already has the content brains (style-adapter, outreach generation).
> Forms: Opus 4.6 has Claude in Excel + PowerPoint. Output = Excel tax reports, PDF summaries, or Obsidian markdown.
> Scope: Basic "categorize transactions" = weekend build. Full tax filing = multi-week.
> `claude plugin install golems-teller` = GOAL, not yet built. Marketplace exists, we publish when ready.

Opus 4.6 scores **76% on TaxEval** and **60.7% on Finance Agent benchmark**.
Can handle: SEC filings, tax analysis, investment research, corporate finance.

### Capabilities for Us
- **Tax categorization**: Already have Sophtron MCP for bank data
- **Expense tracking**: Bank transactions → tax categories
- **Financial reports**: Generate spreadsheets from transaction data
- **Tax prep**: Identify deductions, categorize expenses

### Architecture
```
Sophtron MCP (bank data) → TellerGolem → Tax categories → Obsidian/Excel
                                       → Monthly reports
                                       → Tax prep summaries
```

### Integration with Existing
- Sophtron MCP tools already configured (GETCUSTOMERS, GETACCOUNTS, GETTRANSACTIONS)
- Could use Cowork's Excel plugin for spreadsheet generation
- WhatsApp alerts for unusual transactions

---

## Part 11: Puppeteer User Testing from Recordings

### Concept
1. User walks through app flow (recorded via Playwright codegen)
2. Claude analyzes recording → generates Playwright test
3. Tests run in GitHub Actions on PRs
4. Failed tests = visual regression

### Implementation
```bash
# Record user session
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000

# Claude refines into proper test
claude -p "Refine this Playwright recording into a proper E2E test" < recording.ts

# Add to CI
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
```

### For Domica Team
- Non-technical team members record flows in Cowork
- Claude converts to Playwright tests
- Tests added to PR checks automatically

---

## Part 12: OTP/WhatsApp Semantic Search

### Concept
- Semantic search through WhatsApp messages for OTPs, verification codes
- Filter WhatsApp exports by category (dev, personal, OTP, work)
- Zikaron indexes WhatsApp exports → searchable via `zikaron search "OTP from bank"`

### Dev Tool Categorization
- Parse git commit history across all repos
- Categorize tools used (frameworks, libraries, CLIs)
- Build "developer profile" from actual usage patterns
- Feed into RecruiterGolem for better job matching

---

## Part 13: Skill Reorganization & Extension Architecture (NEW - 2026-02-06)

> **Goal:** Convert flat 34-skill list into proper Claude Code extension categories.
> Make golems "whole" - not just readers but interactive assistants.
> Each golem gets the right extension type: Skill (interactive), MCP (data), Plugin (bundled).

### Current Problem

34 skills dumped in `.claude/commands/golem-powers/` with no clear categorization.
EmailGolem only reads - doesn't organize WITH user or help write replies.
Zikaron has MCP entry point (`zikaron-mcp`) but nobody uses it.
No golems expose data as MCP tools for Claude to use natively.

### Extension Type Mapping

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Skill** (SKILL.md) | Interactive user workflows | `/email organize`, `/outreach review`, `/practice` |
| **MCP Server** (.mcp.json) | Data providers - Claude calls these as tools | `zikaron-search`, `email-getInbox`, `jobs-getMatches` |
| **Plugin** (.claude-plugin/) | Bundled packages for distribution | `golems-recruiter`, `golems-email`, `golems-teller` |
| **Launchd Daemon** | Background workers (no user interaction) | Job scraping, email polling, night shift |

### Skill Reorganization (34 → 6 categories)

**Category 1: Golem Operations** (controlling the system)
- `email-golem` → EVOLVE to full email assistant (see below)
- `notify` - Send notifications
- `tax-helper` → EVOLVE into TellerGolem skill
- `soltome` + `soltome-influencer` → MERGE into `content` skill
- `interview-practice` - Keep as-is

**Category 2: Development Workflow** (code lifecycle)
- `commit` + `ralph-commit` → Keep both (different contexts)
- `create-pr`, `prd`, `prd-manager` - Keep
- `coderabbit` - Keep
- `test-plan`, `archive` - Keep

**Category 3: Code Intelligence** (search/navigate)
- `lsp`, `context7`, `github`, `github-research` - Keep
- `zikaron` → Also add as MCP server

**Category 4: Environment** (setup/config)
- `ralph-install`, `1password`, `project-context`, `context-audit` - Keep
- `brave`, `convex`, `worktrees` - Keep

**Category 5: Context Recovery** (catch up)
- `catchup`, `catchup-recent` - Keep

**Category 6: Meta** (skill management)
- `critique-waves`, `learn-mistake`, `writing-skills`, `skills` - Keep
- `obsidian` - Keep
- `example-bash`, `example-typescript` - Templates, keep

### New MCP Servers to Create

```json
// Add to .mcp.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sophtron": { ... },  // existing
    "zikaron": {
      "command": "zikaron-mcp"
    },

}
```

**Zikaron MCP tools:**
- `zikaron_search` - Semantic search past conversations
- `zikaron_stats` - Get database stats
- `zikaron_style` - Get communication style analysis

**Email MCP tools:**
- `email_getRecent` - Get recent emails (with score filter)
- `email_search` - Search emails by keyword/sender
- `email_categorize` - Interactively categorize emails with user
- `email_draftReply` - Draft reply using semantic style
- `email_getFollowups` - Get emails needing follow-up

**Jobs MCP tools:**
- `jobs_getHot` - Get 8+ scoring jobs
- `jobs_search` - Search job history
- `jobs_getOutreachDrafts` - Get pending outreach drafts

### EmailGolem Evolution: Reader → Assistant

**Current:** Read → Score → Store → Alert (one-way)

**Target:** Full interactive email assistant

```
/email                    → Dashboard: unread count, urgent, follow-ups needed
/email organize           → Walk through inbox WITH user, categorize together
/email reply <id>         → Draft reply using semantic style, user approves
/email followups          → Show emails waiting for response > 3 days
/email subscriptions      → Monthly spend summary, cancel suggestions
/email thread <id>        → Summarize email thread, suggest next action
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create `email-golem/mcp-server.ts` - expose email data as MCP tools
2. Evolve `email-golem` SKILL.md from status-checker to full workflow
3. Add reply drafting using `style-adapter.ts` (already built for recruiter)
4. Add follow-up tracking (new field in Supabase: `needs_followup`, `followup_by`)

### Zikaron Distribution Strategy

| Audience | Format | What They Get |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Technical devs** (us) | MCP server + CLI | Full power: search, index, stats, style analysis |
| **Claude Code users** | Plugin (`golems-zikaron`) | Auto-configured MCP, skill for `/zikaron search` |
| **Non-technical** | NOT for them | Too complex (local Python, embeddings, sqlite-vec) |

**Quick win:** Just enable `zikaron-mcp` in `.mcp.json` - it already works!

### Plugin Bundles (Distribution)

> **SUPERSEDED by Part 14** - see updated bundles that reflect domain golem architecture.
> Key change: No standalone `golems-email` plugin. Email routing is part of `golems-core`.
> Soltome/content is `golems-content` (multi-platform, not Soltome-specific).

Each plugin has: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + skills/ + .mcp.json + hooks/

## Part 14: Architecture Refactor - Domain Golems (2026-02-06)

> **Core insight:** Golems are **domain experts**, not input/output channels.
> Email, Telegram, CLI, MCP, Claude Chat are just interfaces to reach the golems.
> NightShift and Briefing are patterns, not golems. Zikaron is infrastructure.

### What's Wrong Today

| Thing | Current Abstraction | Problem | Should Be |
|-------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| **EmailGolem** | Standalone golem | Email is an input channel, not a domain | **Router** that feeds RecruiterGolem, TellerGolem, Claude Code |
| **NightShift** | Standalone script | Does 3 unrelated things (repo, Soltome learn, drafts) | **Scheduler pattern** - any golem registers overnight work |
| **Briefing** | Standalone script | Just aggregates other golems' data | **Report aggregator** - golems register what they want in briefing |
| **Soltome** | 5 files + 2 skills + part of NightShift | Scattered content creation | **Channel** for ContentGolem (like LinkedIn is for RecruiterGolem) |
| **OllamaGolem** | Separate Telegram bot | Same pattern as ClaudeGolem but for Ollama | **Backend option** for ClaudeGolem or dev tool only |
| **TaxHelper** | Separate package | Tax is one function of finance | Part of **TellerGolem** |
| **Zikaron** | Separate package | Used by all golems for memory + style | **Infrastructure layer** (like Ollama, not a golem) |
| **Helper sprawl** | cursor-helper, gemini-helper, kiro-helper | 3 files, same pattern | One **agent-runner** lib |

### Email Routing (replaces monolithic EmailGolem)

The email triage daemon (launchd, every 10min) stays as-is. It scores emails, then routes:

| Category | Score | Routed To | What Happens |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `interview` | 10 | RecruiterGolem | Telegram alert + auto-prep materials |
| `job` | 7-9 | RecruiterGolem | Morning briefing + outreach check |
| `subscription` | 5-6 | TellerGolem | Subscription tracking, spending report |
| `urgent` | 10 | ClaudeGolem | Immediate Telegram alert |
| `tech-update` | 7-9 | ContentGolem | Potential content ideas |
| Everything else | any | Email MCP | Available for Claude Code reply drafting |

### Soltome = Channel, Not Golem

Soltome is a **posting platform** (like LinkedIn, Twitter, blog). ContentGolem decides WHAT to say, Soltome/LinkedIn/blog are WHERE to say it.

```
ContentGolem
├── Channels:
│   ├── Soltome (soltome-client.ts)     → AI community posts
│   ├── LinkedIn (via recruiter)         → Professional content
│   ├── Blog (future)                    → Long-form articles
│   └── Twitter/X (future)              → Short-form
├── Content Pipeline:
│   ├── soltome-learner.ts              → Learn from platform
│   ├── post-generator.ts              → Critique-waves drafting
│   └── style-adapter.ts              → Voice matching
├── Skills:
│   └── /content (merged soltome + soltome-influencer)
└── Branding Collab:
    └── ContentGolem + RecruiterGolem collaborate on golems branding
        when ready to open-source / share packages
```

### Zikaron = Infrastructure Layer

Zikaron is NOT a golem. It's infrastructure that all golems use, like Ollama.

```
Zikaron provides:
├── Semantic search (past conversations)    → used by ClaudeGolem
├── Style analysis (communication patterns) → used by RecruiterGolem, ContentGolem
├── Memory indexing (session archival)       → used by all
└── MCP server (zikaron-mcp)                → Claude Code integration

Distribution:
├── Claude Code: MCP server in .mcp.json (already done)
├── Claude Chat: paste style summary in project instructions
├── Technical users: pip install zikaron
└── Golems plugin: auto-configured as dependency
```

### NightShift = Scheduler Pattern

Any golem can register "overnight work". NightShift dispatches, not implements.

```typescript
// Each golem registers work it wants done overnight:
interface NightWork {
  golem: string;       // "recruiter" | "content" | "teller"
  task: string;        // "research-new-companies" | "generate-drafts"
  priority: number;    // 1-10
  estimatedMinutes: number;
}

// NightShift at 4am:
// 1. Collect registered work from all golems
// 2. Sort by priority
// 3. Execute within time budget (2 hours)
// 4. Report results to Briefing aggregator

// Current night shift work mapped to golems:
// - Repo improvements → ClaudeGolem (code improvements)
// - Soltome learning → ContentGolem
// - Draft generation → ContentGolem
// - Company research for 8+ jobs → RecruiterGolem
```

### Claude Chat Projects (FREE - Per-Golem Instructions)

Claude Chat (claude.ai) supports per-project custom instructions. Each golem gets its own project:

| Claude Chat Project | Instructions Include | Use Case |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Recruiter** | Job search context, target companies, outreach style, interview prep patterns | "Help me prep for X interview" |
| **Teller** | US + Israel tax rules, bank account structure, expense categories, Sophtron context | "Categorize these transactions" |
| **Content** | Brand voice (SOUL.md), Soltome posting strategy, target audience, past post performance | "Draft a post about X" |
| **Golems Dev** | Full CLAUDE.md, architecture, MCP configs, all technical context | Development work |

**Setup:** Generate `project-instructions.md` per golem from existing CLAUDE.md + SOUL.md + context files.
Paste into claude.ai project settings. Zero code needed.

### Helper Consolidation

```
BEFORE (3 separate files):
├── cursor-helper.ts   → spawns Cursor CLI
├── gemini-helper.ts   → spawns Gemini CLI
├── kiro-helper.ts     → spawns Kiro CLI

AFTER (1 unified runner):
└── lib/agent-runner.ts
    ├── runAgent("cursor", prompt, options)
    ├── runAgent("gemini", prompt, options)
    ├── runAgent("kiro", prompt, options)
    └── runAgent("claude", prompt, options)
```

### Updated Plugin Bundles (reflects domain golems)

```
golems-core/           → Scheduler + Briefing + Notify + golems CLI + event-log
                         (base dependency for all others)

golems-recruiter/      → RecruiterGolem (jobs + outreach + interviews + job emails)
                         MCP: golems-jobs
                         Skills: /jobs, /outreach, /practice
                         Channels: LinkedIn, email
                         Requires: Ollama, golems-core

golems-teller/         → TellerGolem (tax + subscriptions + financial emails + spending)
                         MCP: golems-teller + sophtron
                         Skills: /tax, /spending, /subscriptions
                         Absorbs: packages/tax-helper/
                         Requires: Sophtron MCP, golems-core

golems-content/        → ContentGolem (drafts + brand voice + multi-platform posting)
                         Skills: /content (merged soltome + soltome-influencer)
                         Channels: Soltome, blog, LinkedIn (via recruiter)
                         Uses: style-adapter, critique-waves, post-generator
                         Requires: golems-core
                         Optional: Zikaron (style analysis)

golems-zikaron/        → Zikaron infrastructure (memory + style + search)
                         MCP: zikaron-mcp
                         Skills: /zikaron
                         Note: Infrastructure, not a golem
                         Requires: Python, sentence-transformers, sqlite-vec

golems-email-router/   → Email triage daemon (scores + routes to other golems)
                         MCP: golems-email (for Claude Code reply drafting)
                         Launchd: every 10min polling
                         Routes to: recruiter, teller, or Claude Code
                         Requires: Gmail OAuth, Ollama, golems-core
```

### What This Changes (Migration Path)

1. **No big rewrite needed.** The code mostly stays where it is.
2. **Logical grouping** changes: update imports, move subscription tracking from email to teller.
3. **Skill merges**: `soltome` + `soltome-influencer` → `/content`
4. **NightShift refactor**: Add registration pattern, golems declare what overnight work they want.
5. **Briefing refactor**: Golems register their morning report data.
6. **Claude Chat projects**: Generate instructions from existing context files (zero code).
7. **Helper consolidation**: Merge 3 files into 1 agent-runner.

## Part 15: Per-Golem Output Styles (Research: 2026-02-06)

> Claude Code supports custom output styles via `~/.claude/output-styles/*.md`.
> Each file has frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `keep-coding-instructions`) + markdown body.
> Styles modify system prompt. Periodic reminders enforce adherence.
> Can bundle in plugins via `outputStyles` field in plugin.json.

### Discovered API

```yaml
# ~/.claude/output-styles/recruiter-coach.md
---
name: RecruiterCoach
description: Elevated-professional coaching for job search and outreach
keep-coding-instructions: true
---

## Communication Style
[markdown body becomes system prompt modifier]
```

**Built-in styles:** Default, Explanatory, Learning
**Custom styles:** Any .md file in output-styles directory
**Plugin bundling:** `outputStyles: ["styles/recruiter.md"]` in plugin.json

### Planned Golem Output Styles

| Golem | Style Name | Key Traits |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| RecruiterGolem | `recruiter-coach` | Elevated-professional (~0.58-0.64 formality), NO em dashes, NO AI patterns, match recipient LinkedIn tone |
| TellerGolem | `teller-advisor` | Guiding/explanatory (NOT teaching), friendly financial advisor, clear but not condescending |
| ContentGolem | `content-editor` | Editorial voice, brand-aware, critique-waves integration |
| ClaudeGolem | `claude-casual` | Matches owner style card (0.47 formality), Hebrew/English code-switching |

### Outreach Formality (User Decision)

- Natural voice: ~0.47 formality
- Outreach elevation: **20-30% of remaining space** (0.47 → ~0.58-0.64)
- Plus: **Match recipient's LinkedIn/GitHub tone** per message
- Source: Scrape recipient's LinkedIn posts for tone analysis
- Anti-AI: No em dashes, no weird punctuation, no "Certainly", no corporate speak
- Careful: Don't accidentally commit AI-style patterns in git messages too

| **Remote terminal** | ❌ Not available | Can't bridge to Telegram |
| **File-save hooks** | ❓ Needs investigation | "Can Zed alert Claude on file save?" - user asked |
| **Native Claude agent** | ✅ Built-in | Zed has its own Claude integration |
| **Spring 2026** | 🔜 Planned | Multi-agent collaboration feature |

### Integration Plan

1. **MCP workspace setup** (30min) - Configure existing MCP servers in Zed settings
2. **Interview practice in Zed** - RecruiterGolem creates practice files in IDE, user edits, agent reviews
3. **File-save alerting** - Investigate if Zed can trigger Claude agent on save (user asked this)

### NOT Building

- Remote terminal (not supported)
- Telegram bridge via Zed (not possible)
- Full Zed plugin (overkill for now)

## Part 17: Plugin Security & Distribution (Research: 2026-02-06)

### Claude Code Plugin Security Model

- **Trust-based, NOT sandboxed** - plugins run with full user permissions
- 9000+ community plugins, no centralized vetting
- Known attack vectors: dependency hijacking, hook exploitation
- Anthropic doesn't audit plugins

### Our Distribution Strategy (User Decision)

1. **CC plugin FIRST** - Build golems as Claude Code plugin
2. **Easy to convert to Cowork later** - Same structure, different manifest
3. **Cowork limitations**: No daemon management, single-session, no process spawning
4. **Non-technical users**: Ask their Claude to run `golems update` - Claude reads CHANGELOG, guides them

### Cowork Verdict

- ❌ NOT viable as full plugin (no daemons, no background processes)
- ✅ Read-only dashboard OK (show status, recent jobs, etc.)
- ✅ "The README is the API" - any Claude can operate golems CLI

---

## Part 18: Cloud Offload - Stop Mac 24/7 (2026-02-06)

> **Problem:** Mac must be on 24/7 for launchd daemons (job scraping, email polling, night shift, Ollama scoring, telegram bot).
> **Idea:** Move background polling to Railway/cloud. Mac becomes the "brain" (Claude Code), cloud is the "body" (data collection).

### What Currently Needs Mac On

| Service | Schedule | Why Mac | Cloud-able? |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Telegram bot** | Always on | grammy bot, port 3847 | ✅ Easy - stateless HTTP |
| **Job scraper** | Every 30min | Scrapes → Ollama scores → Supabase | ✅ If Ollama replaced |
| **Email poller** | Every 10min | Gmail API → Ollama scores → Supabase | ✅ If Ollama replaced |
| **Night Shift** | 4am | Spawns Claude Code sessions | ❌ Claude Code is local |
| **Ollama** | On demand | qwen2.5-coder:32b scoring | ⚠️ Needs cloud LLM alternative |
| **Briefing** | 8am | Aggregates data → Telegram | ✅ Easy - reads from Supabase |
| **Soltome learner** | 2am | Scrapes platform | ✅ Easy - stateless |

### Cloud Architecture (Railway/Fly.io)

### Ollama Replacement Options (for cloud scoring)

| Option | Cost | Latency | Quality vs qwen2.5:32b |
|--------|------|---------|------------------------|
| **Groq API** (llama3) | Free tier / $0.05/1M tok | ~200ms | Similar |
| **Together.ai** (qwen2.5) | $0.06/1M tok | ~300ms | Same model! |
| **Claude Haiku** | $0.25/1M tok | ~500ms | Better but pricier |
| **Ollama on Railway** | ~$7/mo (GPU) | ~1s | Exact same |
| **Keep Ollama local** | Free | — | Only works when Mac on |

**Recommendation:** Together.ai running qwen2.5 = same model, cloud-hosted, cheap.
Or Groq for speed. Either way, replace `ollama-wrapper.ts` with API client.

### User Flow After Migration

```bash
# Wake up, open Mac
golems on
# → "Good morning! Overnight: 12 new jobs scored, 3 urgent emails,
#    Night Shift skipped (Mac was off). Run /morning for briefing."

# Sync and process
golems morning
# → Pulls cloud data, shows briefing, queues Night Shift catch-up

# Or from Telegram (works even with Mac off!)
/morning
/jobs
/status
```

### Research Results (2026-02-06)

#### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Always-On Bot | Cron Jobs | Bun Support | GPU | Est. Cost |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| **Railway** | $3-5/mo (256MB) | Built-in (50 on Hobby) | ✅ Native Nixpacks | ❌ None | **$6-8/mo** |
| **Fly.io** | $2/mo (shared) | Complex setup | Via Dockerfile | ⚠️ $1.25/hr | **$3-4/mo** (no GPU) |
| **Render** | $7/mo (Starter) | $1/mo each | Via Dockerfile | ❌ None | **$12/mo** |
| **Coolify** (self-hosted) | VPS $4-10/mo | You manage | Full control | Depends on VPS | **$4-10/mo** |

**Winner: Railway** - Native Bun, built-in crons, excellent DX, fits in $5-8/mo Hobby plan.

#### Ollama Replacement (REQUIRED - no cloud GPU is affordable)

| Provider | Model | Input | Output | Speed | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Groq** | Llama 3.1 8B | $0.05/M | $0.08/M | 840 TPS | Cheapest + fastest |
| **OpenRouter** | Qwen2.5-Coder 32B | $0.03/M | $0.11/M | Slower | Same model we use! |
| **Together.ai** | Qwen2.5 | $0.06/M | — | ~300ms | Good alternative |
| **Claude Haiku** | Haiku 4.5 | $0.25/M | — | ~500ms | Best quality, pricier |

**Estimated LLM API cost:** ~$0.09/month (35 jobs + 20 emails/day = tiny token volume).
**Decision: Use Claude Haiku 4.5** ($0.25/M input, ~$0.50/month total at our volume).
At 35 jobs + 20 emails/day, the cost difference between cheapest and best is 41 cents.
Haiku also handles company research, initial outreach scoring, and email categorization.
The "brain" (Opus/Sonnet for drafting, interview prep) stays local on Claude Code.

#### Umami (Analytics)

**What it is:** Self-hosted, privacy-focused web analytics (Google Analytics alternative).
Railway has a one-click deploy template. Uses PostgreSQL internally.

**Relevance to us:** Could track etanheyman.com portfolio analytics, or Soltome engagement metrics.
**Priority:** LOW - nice-to-have, not blocking anything.

### Migration Path

1. **Move Telegram bot to Railway** (easiest, highest impact - notifications work 24/7)
2. **Replace `ollama-wrapper.ts` with cloud LLM client** (OpenRouter/Groq API)
3. **Move job scraper + email poller** (now cloud-LLM powered, no GPU needed)
4. **Move briefing + soltome learner** (lightweight crons)
5. **Keep Night Shift local** (needs Claude Code, which is local-only)
6. **Add `golems sync` / `golems morning`** for Mac wake-up data pull from Supabase

## Part 19: Claude Code 2.1.30-2.1.33 Audit (2026-02-06)

> Current version: **2.1.33**. Audited changes from 2.1.30-2.1.33.

### USE NOW (High Impact for Golems)

| Feature | Version | What It Means |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Agent Memory** | 2.1.33 | `memory: project` in agent frontmatter. Each golem auto-remembers across sessions. Could supplement/replace event-log.ts for session context. |
| **Sub-Agent Spawning Control** | 2.1.33 | `Task(agent_type)` restricts sub-agents. RecruiterGolem can only spawn allowed agent types. Safer plugin distribution. |
| **68% --resume memory reduction** | 2.1.30 | `--resume telegram-chat` loads way faster. Direct win for our persistent Telegram session. |
| **Task Tool Metrics** | 2.1.30 | Token count + duration on Task results. Can track cost per golem operation, add to briefing. |
| **Plugin names in /skills** | 2.1.33 | `golems-recruiter` shows in skill menu. Better UX for plugin distribution. |
| **/debug command** | 2.1.30 | Built-in troubleshooting. Complements `golems doctor`. |

### PLAN FOR (Medium-Term)

| Feature | Version | What It Means |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Agent Teams** (experimental) | 2.1.32 | Multi-golem orchestration! RecruiterGolem + ContentGolem collaborate. Token-intensive, needs `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. |
| **TeammateIdle + TaskCompleted hooks** | 2.1.33 | ClaudeGolem gets notified when RecruiterGolem finishes. Could replace event-log.ts notification pattern entirely. |
| **PreToolUse → additionalContext** | 2.1.33 | Inject golem-specific context before tool calls. E.g., inject style card before any write operation, or inject anti-AI rules before outreach generation. |
| **MCP OAuth** | 2.1.30 | `claude mcp add --client-id --client-secret`. Easier Gmail OAuth setup for EmailGolem install wizard. |
| **Remote sessions in VSCode** | 2.1.33 | Browse/resume golem sessions from claude.ai. Mobile monitoring potential. |
| **Skill budget scales with context** | 2.1.32 | 2% of context window. Our 34 skills now have more room to show descriptions. |

### NICE-TO-HAVE

| Feature | Note |
|---------|------|
| PDF pages parameter | TellerGolem reading tax docs |
| Bash heredoc fix | JS template literals in bash no longer break |
| /resume session titles | Clean titles instead of XML markup |

### Key Architecture Impact

1. **Agent Memory replaces parts of event-log.ts** - Built-in `memory: project` means golems auto-remember without our custom injection code. But keep curated learnings (learn-mistake skill) - auto-memory catches "what happened", learnings catch "what we decided". Both are valuable.
2. **Agent Teams = golem collaboration** (not Ralph replacement) - Ralph = solo autonomous loop. Teams = multi-golem collab (RecruiterGolem + ContentGolem draft together). When Teams stabilizes, Ralph could dispatch to teams internally.
3. **Hook events enable reactive golems** - `TaskCompleted` means ClaudeGolem can react to any golem finishing work. True event-driven architecture. The missing piece for golem collaboration.
4. **PreToolUse context injection** - Per file type:
   - `.he.tsx` → RTL + TypeScript + React + possibly Next.js rules
   - `.tsx` → TypeScript + React (no RTL)
   - `.native.tsx` → React Native / Expo rules
   - Any write in RecruiterGolem → "no em dashes, match recipient tone" anti-AI rules
5. **Auto-inject plugins per project** - Plugins like `frontend-design` provide skills but don't auto-activate. Use PreToolUse hook to inject plugin context automatically based on project:
   - `domica`, `songscript`, `etanheyman.com` → auto-inject `frontend-design` + `web-design-guidelines` rules on any UI file edit
   - `domica` → also inject RTL rules (already in CLAUDE.md, but plugin adds opinionated design critique on top)
   - `golems/recruiter-golem` → auto-inject anti-AI outreach style
   - Implementation: PreToolUse hook checks project root / file extension → reads relevant plugin skill files → returns as `additionalContext`
   - Alternatively: per-project `.claude/settings.json` with `autoInjectPlugins: ["frontend-design"]` (if CC adds this)

### Frontend Design Plugin (INSTALLED - 2026-02-06)

`claude plugin install frontend-design` - Official Anthropic plugin.
Forces bold, production-grade UI instead of generic AI slop.
- No Inter/Roboto defaults, no purple gradients
- Distinctive typography, cohesive palettes, real animations
- Spatial composition, grid-breaking, context-specific character

**Use for:** etanheyman.com, domica, songscript, any frontend work.

## Part 20: Documentation, Wizard, Monitoring & Security (2026-02-06)

> Added after Phase 2 code complete. Tracks 10-17 cover discoverability, setup UX, centralization, monitoring, and security.

### Cross-Cutting Requirements (ALL tracks must follow)

1. **TDD** — Write tests first or alongside. Every new module has its own test file. No PR without passing tests.
2. **Context7 verification** — Before shipping, use `/context7` skill to check that our code uses libraries correctly (Anthropic SDK, Supabase client, Grammy, Gmail API, etc.). Catch deprecated methods, wrong API patterns, missing options.
3. **Cursor CLI mapping** — Use `cursor agent "@codebase <question>" --output-format text` to map and verify codebase state. Especially for docs and coverage sweep.
4. **Documentation** — Every track updates relevant docs (CLAUDE.md, plan, or doc site). No undocumented features.
5. **1Password** — All secrets flow through 1Password. Never hardcode, never commit `.env` files.

### Centralization Principle

**Everything must be easy to find and manage** — for humans, for Claude, for any tooling:

| What | Where | NOT scattered across |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Runtime state** | `~/.golems-zikaron/` (local) or Supabase (cloud) | ~/random dirs, /tmp |
| **Secrets** | 1Password (source of truth) → env vars | .env files, hardcoded |
| **Config** | `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy (global → repo → package) | Random dotfiles |
| **Docs (public)** | `docs/` in repo root | docs.local (working drafts only) |
| **Skills** | `packages/ralph/skills/golem-powers/` (symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/) | Duplicated across packages |
| **Learnings** | `~/.claude/learnings/` (global) + `docs.local/learnings/` (project) | Scattered .md files |
| **Plans** | `docs/golems-v2-branding-plan.md` (canonical) | Multiple copies in docs.local |
| **Monitoring** | UptimeRobot → Telegram topic | Manual checks, hope-based uptime |

The wizard (Track 12) and docs (Track 11) must enforce this — every setup produces the same predictable layout.

---

### Track 9: Local Cleanup (launchd + bin/golems)

**Status:** Pending (after Railway confirmed stable)
- Disable launchd plists for email-golem and job-golem (cloud handles these now)
- Update `bin/golems` CLI: add `golems cloud` command showing Railway health
- Update `healthcheck.ts` to ping Railway `/health` endpoint
- Add Railway/cloud status to ccstatusline

**Tests:** healthcheck.test.ts for Railway ping, golems CLI unit tests
**Context7:** Verify launchd plist format, Railway health check patterns
**Docs:** Update CLAUDE.md Phase 2 section with which services are local vs cloud

---

### Track 10: Storage Audit

**File:** `scripts/storage-audit-prompt.md` ✅ EXISTS
- 7-phase non-destructive audit: disk overview, ghost detection, staleness, recurring growers, large files, Android SDK, browsers
- UX flow: announce checkup → scan silently → full report → ask what to delete → confirm each action
- Runs **pre-setup** (baseline) and **post-setup** (cleanup redundant local state)
- Weekly automated cleanup via `scripts/storage-cleanup.sh` + launchd plist

**Tests:** Dry-run mode test (verify no deletions), report format validation
**Docs:** Add to wizard pre-flight and post-flight phases

---

### Track 11: Documentation Site

**Stack:** Docusaurus or MkDocs
**Sections:**
1. Getting Started — what Golems is, what it changes on your system
2. Phase 1 — email routing, reply drafting, follow-ups, content pipeline
3. Phase 2 — cloud offload (Railway, Supabase, Haiku, env vars)
4. Per-Golem Guides — RecruiterGolem, TellerGolem, ContentGolem, ClaudeGolem
5. MCP Servers — zikaron, golems-email, golems-jobs
6. Configuration Reference — all env vars, 1Password items, launchd plists
7. Architecture — domain golems principle (Part 14)
8. Monitoring & Security — UptimeRobot, Dependabot, Snyk, Socket.dev setup

**Build workflow:** Parallel Haiku-powered Claude Code agents draft sections, main agent reviews/organizes. Cursor CLI `@codebase` for automated codebase mapping. Context7 for verifying all library usage is correct.

**Tests:** Link checker (no dead links), code snippet validation (examples actually run)
**Cursor CLI:** `cursor agent "@codebase list all exported functions and their purpose" --output-format text` to auto-generate API reference sections

---

### Track 12: Golem CLI Wizard (`golems setup`)

Interactive setup for new projects or new Macs. Modular — user picks which services to enable.

**Each step explicitly tells the user:**
- What it will do
- Disk/network/system impact
- Permissions needed
- Risks and how to rollback
- Asks for confirmation even on bypass mode

**Phases:** Pre-flight audit (Track 10) → Core setup → Service selection → 1Password secrets → Deploy (Railway or launchd) → Monitoring setup (Track 15) → Verify → Post-flight audit

**Output:** `SETUP_LOG.md` documenting exactly what was configured.

**Tests:** Mock wizard run (no real system changes), verify each phase produces correct output
**Context7:** Verify 1Password CLI usage, Railway CLI patterns, launchd plist format

---

### Track 13: Coverage Sweep

Final pass after all other tracks:
- Cursor CLI `@codebase` full mapping
- Cross-reference docs vs actual code
- Context7 verify ALL library imports against current docs
- Find undocumented env vars, MCP tools, skills
- Fill gaps, remove stale references
- Verify all tests pass, no orphaned test files

---

### Track 14: Golem Admin UI (`@golems/admin`)

**Package:** `packages/admin-ui`
- Embeddable React admin interface
- Shows: golem status, event log, API usage/costs, outreach pipeline, email routing, uptime status
- Reads from Supabase (cloud) or local state (file)
- Publishable as `@golems/admin` — drop into any website
- Standalone (Vite) or embeddable component

**Tests:** Component tests (Vitest + Testing Library), mock Supabase responses
**Context7:** Verify React, Vite, Supabase client usage

---

### Track 15: Uptime Monitoring

**Service:** UptimeRobot (free tier: 50 monitors, 5min intervals)
**Telegram:** New topic `#uptime` in Golems group for alerts

**Monitors:**
| Monitor | URL | Interval | Alert |
|---------|-----|----------|-------|
| Railway Health | `https://<railway-url>/health` | 5min | Telegram #uptime topic |
| Railway Usage | `https://<railway-url>/usage` | 30min | Telegram (cost spike alert) |
| Supabase | `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/rest/v1/` | 5min | Telegram #uptime topic |

**Setup:**
1. Create UptimeRobot account (free)
2. Add Telegram integration (Bot API webhook → uptime topic)
3. Create monitors for each endpoint
4. Add status badge to README / admin UI

**Docs:** Document UptimeRobot setup in wizard and doc site. Add to 1Password if API key needed.

---

### Track 16: Security Tooling

**Free tools for open source:**

| Tool | What | Setup |
|------|------|-------|
| **GitHub Dependabot** | Auto PRs for vulnerable deps | Enable in repo Settings → Security |
| **Snyk** | Deep dependency scanning + container scanning | `snyk auth` + GitHub integration |
| **Socket.dev** | Supply chain attack detection (typosquatting, install scripts) | GitHub App install |
| **GitHub Secret Scanning** | Detect leaked secrets in commits | Enable in repo Settings → Security |
| **CodeQL** | Static analysis (XSS, injection, etc.) | GitHub Actions workflow |

**Priority order:**
1. Dependabot (5min setup, immediate value)
2. Secret Scanning (1min toggle, catches leaks)
3. Socket.dev (5min GitHub App install)
4. Snyk (10min, container scanning for Dockerfile)
5. CodeQL (30min, GitHub Actions workflow)

**Tests:** CI must pass all security checks before merge
**Docs:** Security section in doc site, badge in README

---

### Track 17: Telegram Topic for Monitoring

Add new topic to Golems Telegram group:
- `#uptime` — UptimeRobot alerts, Railway health changes, security scan results
- Get thread ID, add to state.json and Railway env vars (`TELEGRAM_TOPIC_UPTIME`)
- Update `telegram-direct.ts` source→topic mapping

---

### Implementation Order (Phase 2.5)

| # | Track | Depends On | Effort |
|---|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Track 9:** Local cleanup | Railway stable ✅ | 1-2hr |
| 2 | **Track 15:** Uptime monitoring | Railway deployed ✅ | 30min |
| 3 | **Track 16:** Security tooling | Repo exists ✅ | 1hr |
| 4 | **Track 17:** Telegram uptime topic | Track 15 | 15min |
| 5 | **Track 10:** Storage audit | Independent ✅ | Done |
| 6 | **Track 11:** Documentation site | Tracks 9-10 done | 4-6hr |
| 7 | **Track 12:** CLI wizard | Track 11 (needs docs structure) | 4-6hr |
| 8 | **Track 14:** Admin UI | Tracks 11-12 | 6-8hr |
| 9 | **Track 13:** Coverage sweep | Everything else | 2-3hr |

## Appendix A: Railway Deployment Reference

> Deployed 2026-02-06 via Railway CLI.

### Project
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project** | `your-railway-org` |
| **Service** | `golems` |
| **Root Directory** | `packages/autonomous` |
| **Builder** | Dockerfile |
| **Health Check** | `/health` |
| **Usage Endpoint** | `/usage` |
| **Branch** | `master` (auto-deploy on push) |

### CLI Setup
```bash
brew install railway
railway login          # opens browser
cd packages/autonomous
railway link           # select your-org → your-project
railway variables      # view env vars
railway up             # manual deploy
railway logs           # tail logs
```

### Environment Variables (17 total)
| Variable | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | 1Password (any item name) | Haiku 4.5 calls |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase dashboard | `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` project |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Supabase dashboard | service_role, bypasses RLS |
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` | Google Cloud Console | OAuth2 for email polling |
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Cloud Console | OAuth2 |
| `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth2 flow | Long-lived refresh token |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | @BotFather | GolemsBot |

Flip to local mode by changing 3 vars:
```bash
railway variables --set "LLM_BACKEND=ollama" --set "STATE_BACKEND=file" --set "TELEGRAM_MODE=local"
```

## Part 21: Wizard v2 - Consent-First Onboarding (2026-02-07)

> **Core principle:** The wizard NEVER reads files, scans directories, or checks anything without asking first. Every step starts with a question, not an action. The user is always in control.

### Entry Paths

```
Welcome to Golems! I can help you set up. Would you like to:

a) "Tell me about your projects and I'll suggest what fits"
b) "Let me scan your repos folder so I can see what you work with"  (explicit opt-in)
c) "Just show me what Golems offers and I'll pick manually"
d) "I already know what I want - let me choose directly"
```

### Layer Selection (multi-select per layer)

| Layer | Options | What It Configures |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Infra** | Railway, Supabase, 1Password, local-only | Cloud deploy, DB backend, secrets |
| **Cloud** | Polling frequency (light/standard/aggressive), timezone | Smart scheduling in cloud-worker.ts |
| **Context** | Which projects to monitor, CLAUDE.md hierarchy | Per-project plugin injection |
| **Personas** | Style card from Zikaron, custom personas, templates | Output styles, SOUL.md |
| **Integrations** | Telegram, email, job boards, Soltome | MCP servers, OAuth, API keys |

### Context Export for claude.ai

```bash
golems export-context
# Generates scrubbed files for claude.ai Project Knowledge:
# - style-card.md (template, not personal data)
# - CLAUDE.md hierarchy summary
# - MCP server configs
# - Persona templates (skeleton, not soul)
```

### Output

- CLAUDE.md hierarchy created
- MCP configs wired (.mcp.json)
- Launchd plists or Railway env vars set

## Part 22: Smart Scheduling (DONE - 2026-02-07)

> **Status:** Implemented in `cloud-worker.ts` (commit `7e7c3b0`).

### Israel Timezone Awareness

```typescript
getIsraelHour()      // Current hour in Asia/Jerusalem
getIsraelDay()       // 0=Sun, 6=Sat
isIsraeliWorkday()   // Sun-Thu (0-4)
isWorkHours()        // 8am-8pm Israel time
```

### Schedules

| Service | Old | New | Savings |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Email** | Every 10min (144/day) | 1h work hours, 3h overnight (~14/day) | 90% |
| **Jobs** | Every 30min (48/day, 336/week) | 9am + 1pm Sun-Thu (~10/week) | 97% |
| **Briefing** | 8am daily | 8am daily (unchanged) | — |
| **Soltome** | 2am daily | 2am daily (unchanged) | — |

### UptimeRobot Webhook

Cloud worker exposes `POST /webhook/uptimerobot` → sends alerts to Telegram uptime topic.

## Part 23: Docs-from-Code Pipeline (2026-02-07)

> **Goal:** Auto-generate API docs from TSDoc comments. No fake examples — use real code structure.

### Stack

- **TypeDoc** extracts TSDoc comments → JSON
- **docusaurus-plugin-typedoc** renders API reference in Docusaurus
- Integrates with existing `packages/docs` site

### What Gets Documented

| Module | Key Exports |
|--------|-------------|
| `lib/cloud-llm.ts` | `runHaiku()`, `runHaikuJSON()`, `getUsageStats()` |
| `lib/state-store.ts` | `getState()`, `setState()`, `logEvent()` |
| `lib/telegram-direct.ts` | `sendNotification()` |
| `lib/agent-runner.ts` | `runAgent()` |
| `email-golem/router.ts` | `routeEmail()` |
| `email-golem/followup.ts` | `createFollowup()`, `getOverdueFollowups()` |

### Tools to Investigate

- Augmented code, Soy Dev sponsors, Theo.gg tools for docs-from-code
- Cursor CLI `@codebase` for automated codebase mapping

## Part 24: Distribution Model (2026-02-07)

> **Two distribution paths, not one.**

### Path 1: MCP Servers (Broader Reach)

Works in ANY MCP-compatible editor (Zed, Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code).
- `golems-email` — 7 tools for email triage
- `golems-jobs` — job search tools
- `zikaron` — semantic memory search

### Path 2: Claude Code Plugins (Deeper Integration)

Skills, contexts, personas, CLAUDE.md hierarchy, hooks.
- Richer experience but Claude Code only
- Plugin manifests in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

### Distribution Tiers

| Tier | Audience | What They Get |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **1 (Easy)** | Anyone | MCP servers + `golems setup`. Job scraping, email, Telegram OOB |
| **2 (Power User)** | CLI-comfortable | + Style card via Zikaron, custom scheduling, personas |
| **3 (Developer)** | Contributors | + Custom skills, new golems, modify contexts, contribute back |

### Public vs Local Rule

| Public (in repo) | Local (never push) |
|------|------|
| Example contexts, example personas | Real style-card.md, profile.json |
| MCP server code, skills framework | Golem personas with personal rules |
| Wizard, docs site, templates | docs.local/, Zikaron data, archives |

**Principle: "Ship the skeleton, keep the soul local"**

## Part 25: Autonomous Pipeline & Multi-Model Orchestration (2026-02-07)

> **Goal:** Enable Claude Code to work autonomously through remaining tracks using parallel multi-model pipelines.

### Multi-Model File Processing

**Problem:** Reading large files (>100 lines) into Opus context causes compaction and context loss.

**Solution:** `scripts/summarize-file.sh` — sends files to external models for processing:

```bash
./scripts/summarize-file.sh docs/plan.md "What's DONE vs NOT DONE?" gemini
./scripts/summarize-file.sh src/big-file.ts "Summarize key functions" cursor
```

| Backend | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Quick summaries | Free (1K/day) |
| **Cursor CLI** | Deep code analysis (GPT-5.3) | Subscription |
| **Kiro CLI** | Code review | Free tier |
| **Haiku** | Cheap API summaries | $0.25/M tokens |
| **Ollama** (Qwen Coder) | Offline code analysis | Free (local) |

### Claude Code Agent Teams

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

- `memory: project` in agent frontmatter = all agents share MEMORY.md
- `TeammateIdle` / `TaskCompleted` hooks for event-driven golem collaboration
- Replace event-log.ts notification pattern for inter-golem communication

### Context7 Quality Gate

After each code change, agents verify library usage:
1. Check imports against Context7 docs
2. If library used incorrectly → log to `docs.local/issues-concerns.md`
3. If change breaks because of Context7 finding → leave explanation in issues file

### Parallel Pipeline Pattern

```
Main Agent (Opus)
├── Spawns research agents (Sonnet/Haiku) for exploration
├── Spawns Gemini/Cursor for file summarization
├── All agents write to shared scratchpad
├── Main reads only summaries (never raw files)
└── Context7 verification on all code changes
```

### Known Bug: `classifyHandoffIfNeeded`

Task agents crash on exit (CC bug, not ours). Agents complete work but get marked "failed".
- GitHub issues: #22544, #22312, #22098, #22087
- Workaround: Have agents write results to files before exit

## Appendix B: Path Variables

> Internal path variables used throughout this document.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$GOLEMS_DATA` | Runtime state directory (state.json, event-log, job-golem data) |
| `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT` | Obsidian research vault |

## Part 26: External CLI Helpers Layer

### Problem
Multiple external CLI tools (Gemini, Cursor, Kiro, Codex) are used for summarization, doc generation, and code analysis. Each has different rate limits, auth methods, and syntax. Currently `scripts/summarize-file.sh` hardcodes each backend.

### Architecture: `src/lib/helpers.ts`

**Unified helper interface:**
```typescript
interface HelperResult { output: string; model: string; tokens?: number; }
type HelperBackend = "gemini" | "cursor" | "codex" | "kiro" | "haiku";

async function runHelper(prompt: string, opts?: { backend?: HelperBackend; file?: string; timeout?: number }): Promise<HelperResult>
```

**Rate limit tracker:** `~/.golems-zikaron/rate-limits.json`
```json
{
  "gemini": { "used": 342, "limit": 1000, "resets": "2026-02-08T00:00:00Z" },
  "cursor": { "used": 89, "limit": 500, "resets": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z" },
  "codex": { "rpm_used": 12, "rpm_limit": 60, "window_start": "..." },
  "kiro": { "used": 12, "limit": null, "resets": null }
}
```

**Fallback chain:** gemini (free, 1000/day) → kiro (free) → codex (pay-per-token) → cursor ($20/mo) → haiku (our API)

**When rate limited:**
1. Log to rate-limits.json with reset time
2. Auto-fallback to next available backend
3. If ALL backends exhausted → notify via Telegram + set timer for earliest reset
4. Background timer triggers retry when limit clears

**Files:**
- `src/lib/helpers.ts` — Unified interface, rate tracking, fallback logic
- `scripts/summarize-file.sh` — Refactored to call helpers.ts (or remain shell wrapper)
- `~/.golems-zikaron/rate-limits.json` — Persistent rate limit state

**CLI backends reference:**

| Backend | Command | Auth | Free Tier | Rate Limit |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|------------|
| Gemini | `gemini "prompt"` | Google account | 1000 req/day | Daily reset midnight UTC |
| Cursor | `cursor agent "prompt" --model gpt-5.2-codex-high --output-format text` | Cursor Pro ($20/mo) | Included | ~500 fast/mo |
| Codex | `codex "prompt"` (API key mode) | OpenAI API key | Pay-per-token | Standard API RPM/TPM |
| Kiro | `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive "prompt"` | AWS account | Free tier | Unknown |
| Haiku | Via Anthropic API | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Pay-per-token | $0.80/MTok in, $4/MTok out |

**Effort:** 3h | **Impact:** HIGH (enables all multi-model workflows)

## Part 27: Qodo Merge for Test Generation

### Problem
job-golem (6 files, 0 tests) and recruiter-golem (10 files, minimal tests) have major test gaps. Manual test writing is slow.

### Solution
Add Qodo Merge (formerly CodiumAI) specifically for test generation (not review — CodeRabbit handles that).

**Setup:**
1. Install Qodo Merge GitHub App on EtanHey/golems
2. Configure to ONLY run `/generate_tests` (disable /review, /improve — overlap with CodeRabbit)
3. Trigger via PR comment: `/test` on files with low coverage

**PR Tool Stack (final):**

| Tool | Role | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| CodeRabbit | Full review + suggestions | Auto on every PR |
| Cursor Bugbot | Bug detection | Auto on every PR |
| Qodo Merge | Test generation ONLY | On-demand `/test` comment |

**Do NOT add:** Greptile, Sourcery, Codacy, GitHub Copilot review — overlap creates noise. Research confirmed: 1-2 well-tuned tools > 5 noisy ones.

**Effort:** 30min setup | **Impact:** HIGH (fills biggest quality gap)

---

## Part 28: Coverage Sweep (FINAL TRACK)

**NOTE:** This track runs LAST after all other tracks are complete, so it catches everything.

### Goal
Final verification pass: cross-reference code vs docs vs tests.

### Multi-model doc sweep pipeline:
1. **Cursor @codebase** → generates initial docs (best cross-file understanding)
2. **Codex** → verifies/enriches (different model perspective)
3. **Gemini** → final review (free, 1M context for whole-file reads)
4. **Claude haiku agent** → commits what passes verification

### Checklist:
- [ ] All env vars documented in docsite/docs/configuration/env-vars.md
- [ ] All MCP tools documented in docsite/docs/mcp-tools.md
- [ ] All exported functions have TSDoc
- [ ] Test coverage: every src/ directory has __tests__/
- [ ] Docusaurus builds clean
- [ ] No stale references to packages/docs (renamed to docsite)
- [ ] UptimeRobot monitoring doc includes mobile app section
- [ ] rate-limits.json schema documented

**Effort:** 2-3h | **Impact:** MEDIUM (quality gate before "done")
