# Architecture Decisions

This folder is the **canonical record** of architectural decisions made in the golems monorepo.

## Convention

When making architecture decisions:

1. **Create a `.md` file** in this folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `telegram-topic-simplification.md`)
2. **Include**: context, options considered, decision, rationale
3. **Date it**: Include the date the decision was made
4. **Keep it factual**: These are reference docs, not opinions

## Auto-Indexing

Files in this folder get indexed into BrainLayer for semantic search:

```bash
# Search past decisions
brainlayer search "telegram routing" --project golems

# Or via MCP
mcp__brainlayer__brainlayer_search(query="telegram routing", project="-Users-etanheyman-Gits-golems")
```
